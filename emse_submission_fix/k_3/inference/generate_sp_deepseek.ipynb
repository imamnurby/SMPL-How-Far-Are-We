      "The Linux operating system (OS) is evolving rapidly to improve performance and to provide new features. This evolution, however, makes it difficult to maintain platform-specific code such as device drivers. Indeed, an evolution in a driver support library often triggers the need for multiple collateral evolutions in dependent device drivers, to bring the drivers up to date with the new library API. Currently, collateral evolutions are mostly done manually. The large number of drivers, however, implies that this approach is time-consuming and unreliable, leading to subtle errors when modifications are not done consistently. Moreover, as these collateral evolutions are often poorly documented, the resulting maintenance is difficult and costly, frequently introducing mistakes. If a driver maintainer becomes unavailable, the driver quickly falls behind the rest of the OS.\n",

      "### Example 1: Adding an argument to `usb_submit_urb`\n",
      "The USB library function usb_submit_urb implements the passing of a message, which is implemented as a USB Request Block (urb). This function uses the kernel memory-allocation function, kmalloc, which must be passed a flag indicating the circumstances in which blocking is allowed. Up through Linux 2.5.3, the flag was chosen in the implementation of usb_submit_urb using the function in_interrupt() to check the status of interrupts, as blocking is not allowed when interrupts are disabled. Starting in Linux 2.5.4, usb_submit_urb it was found that this solution was unsatisfactory and that the caller should instead provide information about the calling context explicitly. Accordingly, an extra argument was added to usb_submit_urb, which should have one of the following values: GFP_KERNEL (no constraints), GFP_ATOMIC (blocking not allowed), or GFP_NOIO (blocking allowed but not I/O).\n",
      "\n",
      "With this change to the interface, the programmer of device-specific code must extend each call to usb_submit_urb with GFP_KERNEL, GFP_ATOMIC, or GFP_NOIO. Some guidance is given in the comments associated with the definition of usb_submit_urb. For example, GFP_ATOMIC is required when locks are held or in a completion handler. The modification is illustrated by the following example diff, extracted from drivers/usb/audio.c (later named drivers/usb/class/audio.c):\n",

      "The function check_region is used in the initialization of device drivers, in determining whether a given device is installed. In early versions of Linux, the kernel initializes device drivers sequentially. In this case, a driver determines whether its device is attached to a given port using the following protocol: (i) call check_region to find out whether the memory region associated with the port is already allocated to another driver, (ii) if not, then perform some driver-specific tests to identify the device attached to the port, and (iii) if the desired device is found, then call request_region to reserve the memory region for the current driver.\n",
      "\n",
      "In more recent versions of Linux, the kernel initializes device drivers concurrently. In this case, between the call to check_region and the call to request_region some other driver may claim the same memory region and initialize the device. To solve this problem, starting with Linux 2.4.2, device-specific code was rewritten to replace the call to check_region in step (i) with a call to request_region, to reserve the memory region. Given this change, if in step (ii) the expected device is not found, then release_region must be used to release the memory region. The transformation is illustrated by the modifications to drivers/char/logibusmouse.c between Linux 2.4.18 and 2.4.19:\n",

      "Coccinelle is a program transformation engine developed to address the problem of collateral evolution in drivers. The key idea of Coccinelle is to shift the burden of collateral evolution from the driver maintainer to the OS developer who performs the original OS evolution, and who thus understands this evolution best. In our vision, the OS developer first uses the Coccinelle transformation language to write a semantic patch describing the required collateral evolution in device drivers and then uses the Coccinelle transformation tool to validate the semantic patch on the drivers in the Linux source distribution. When he has confidence in the correctness of the semantic patch, he distributes it for use by the maintainers of other drivers. Overall, Coccinelle will provide a means for formally documenting collateral evolutions and for easing the application of these evolutions to driver code.\n",

      "Our goal is to document and automate the kinds of collateral evolutions that occur in device driver code. Because Linux programmers are accustomed to manipulating program modifications in terms of patch files, we base our transformation language on the patch syntax, extending patches to semantic patches. But as opposed to a traditional patch, a single small semantic patch can modify hundreds of files, at thousands of code sites. This is because the features of our semantic patch language (SmPL) make a semantic patch generic by abstracting away the specific details and variations at each code site among all drivers.

      "## Collateral Evolutions\n",
      "The Linux operating system (OS) is evolving rapidly to improve performance and to provide new features. This evolution, however, makes it difficult to maintain platform-specific code such as device drivers. Indeed, an evolution in a driver support library often triggers the need for multiple collateral evolutions in dependent device drivers, to bring the drivers up to date with the new library API. Currently, collateral evolutions are mostly done manually. The large number of drivers, however, implies that this approach is time-consuming and unreliable, leading to subtle errors when modifications are not done consistently. Moreover, as these collateral evolutions are often poorly documented, the resulting maintenance is difficult and costly, frequently introducing mistakes. If a driver maintainer becomes unavailable, the driver quickly falls behind the rest of the OS.\n",

      "### Example 1: Adding an argument to `usb_submit_urb`\n",
      "The USB library function usb_submit_urb implements the passing of a message, which is implemented as a USB Request Block (urb). This function uses the kernel memory-allocation function, kmalloc, which must be passed a flag indicating the circumstances in which blocking is allowed. Up through Linux 2.5.3, the flag was chosen in the implementation of usb_submit_urb using the function in_interrupt() to check the status of interrupts, as blocking is not allowed when interrupts are disabled. Starting in Linux 2.5.4, usb_submit_urb it was found that this solution was unsatisfactory and that the caller should instead provide information about the calling context explicitly. Accordingly, an extra argument was added to usb_submit_urb, which should have one of the following values: GFP_KERNEL (no constraints), GFP_ATOMIC (blocking not allowed), or GFP_NOIO (blocking allowed but not I/O).\n",
      "\n",
      "With this change to the interface, the programmer of device-specific code must extend each call to usb_submit_urb with GFP_KERNEL, GFP_ATOMIC, or GFP_NOIO. Some guidance is given in the comments associated with the definition of usb_submit_urb. For example, GFP_ATOMIC is required when locks are held or in a completion handler. The modification is illustrated by the following example diff, extracted from drivers/usb/audio.c (later named drivers/usb/class/audio.c):\n",

      "### Example 2: Changing the driver initialization protocol `check_region`\n",
      "The function check_region is used in the initialization of device drivers, in determining whether a given device is installed. In early versions of Linux, the kernel initializes device drivers sequentially. In this case, a driver determines whether its device is attached to a given port using the following protocol: (i) call check_region to find out whether the memory region associated with the port is already allocated to another driver, (ii) if not, then perform some driver-specific tests to identify the device attached to the port, and (iii) if the desired device is found, then call request_region to reserve the memory region for the current driver.\n",
      "\n",
      "In more recent versions of Linux, the kernel initializes device drivers concurrently. In this case, between the call to check_region and the call to request_region some other driver may claim the same memory region and initialize the device. To solve this problem, starting with Linux 2.4.2, device-specific code was rewritten to replace the call to check_region in step (i) with a call to request_region, to reserve the memory region. Given this change, if in step (ii) the expected device is not found, then release_region must be used to release the memory region. The transformation is illustrated by the modifications to drivers/char/logibusmouse.c between Linux 2.4.18 and 2.4.19:\n",

      "## Coccinelle\n",
      "Coccinelle is a program transformation engine developed to address the problem of collateral evolution in drivers. The key idea of Coccinelle is to shift the burden of collateral evolution from the driver maintainer to the OS developer who performs the original OS evolution, and who thus understands this evolution best. In our vision, the OS developer first uses the Coccinelle transformation language to write a semantic patch describing the required collateral evolution in device drivers and then uses the Coccinelle transformation tool to validate the semantic patch on the drivers in the Linux source distribution. When he has confidence in the correctness of the semantic patch, he distributes it for use by the maintainers of other drivers. Overall, Coccinelle will provide a means for formally documenting collateral evolutions and for easing the application of these evolutions to driver code.\n",

      "## Semantic Patches\n",
      "Our goal is to document and automate the kinds of collateral evolutions that occur in device driver code. Because Linux programmers are accustomed to manipulating program modifications in terms of patch files, we base our transformation language on the patch syntax, extending patches to semantic patches. But as opposed to a traditional patch, a single small semantic patch can modify hundreds of files, at thousands of code sites. This is because the features of our semantic patch language (SmPL) make a semantic patch generic by abstracting away the specific details and variations at each code site among all drivers. Semantic patches, and the associated transformation engine spatch, abstract away:\n",

The key idea of Coccinelle is to shift the burden of collateral evolution from the driver maintainer to the OS developer who performs the original OS evolution, and who thus understands this evolution best. In our vision, the OS developer first uses the Coccinelle transformation language to write a semantic patch describing the required collateral evolution in device drivers and then uses the Coccinelle transformation tool to validate the semantic patch on the drivers in the Linux source distribution. When he has confidence in the correctness of the semantic patch, he distributes it for use by the maintainers of other drivers. Overall, Coccinelle will provide a means for formally documenting collateral evolutions and for easing the application of these evolutions to driver code.\n",

But as opposed to a traditional patch, a single small semantic patch can modify hundreds of files, at thousands of code sites.

The key idea of Coccinelle is to shift the burden of collateral evolution from the driver maintainer to the OS developer who performs the original OS evolution, and who thus understands this evolution best. In our vision, the OS developer first uses the Coccinelle transformation language to write a semantic patch describing the required collateral evolution in device drivers and then uses the Coccinelle transformation tool to validate the semantic patch on the drivers in the Linux source distribution. When he has confidence in the correctness of the semantic patch, he distributes it for use by the maintainers of other drivers. Overall, Coccinelle will provide a means for formally documenting collateral evolutions and for easing the application of these evolutions to driver code.\\n\\n## Semantic Patches\\nOur goal is to document and automate the kinds of collateral evolutions that occur in device driver code. Because Linux programmers are accustomed to manipulating program modifications in terms of patch files, we base our transformation language on the patch syntax, extending patches to semantic patches.

This is because the features of our semantic patch language (SmPL) make a semantic patch generic by abstracting away the specific details and variations at each code site among all drivers.

This evolution, however, makes it difficult to maintain platform-specific code such as device drivers. Indeed, an evolution in a driver support library often triggers the need for multiple collateral evolutions in dependent device drivers, to bring the drivers up to date with the new library API. Currently, collateral evolutions are mostly done manually. The large number of drivers, however, implies that this approach is time-consuming and unreliable, leading to subtle errors when modifications are not done consistently. Moreover, as these collateral evolutions are often poorly documented, the resulting maintenance is difficult and costly, frequently introducing mistakes. If a driver maintainer becomes unavailable, the driver quickly falls behind the rest of the OS.\\n\\n### Example 1: Adding an argument to `usb_submit_urb`\\nThe USB library function usb_submit_urb implements the passing of a message, which is implemented as a USB Request Block (urb). This function uses the kernel memory-allocation function, kmalloc, which must be passed a flag indicating the circumstances in which blocking is allowed. Up through Linux 2.5.3, the flag was chosen in the implementation of usb_submit_urb using the function in_interrupt() to check the status of interrupts, as blocking is not allowed when interrupts are disabled. Starting in Linux 2.5.4, usb_submit_urb it was found that this solution was unsatisfactory and that the caller should instead provide information about the calling context explicitly. Accordingly, an extra argument was added to usb_submit_urb, which should have one of the following values: GFP_KERNEL (no constraints), GFP_ATOMIC (blocking not allowed), or GFP_NOIO (blocking allowed but not I/O).\\n\\nWith this change to the interface, the programmer of device-specific code must extend each call to usb_submit_urb with GFP_KERNEL, GFP_ATOMIC, or GFP_NOIO. Some guidance is given in the comments associated with the definition of usb_submit_urb. For example, GFP_ATOMIC is required when locks are held or in a completion handler. The modification is illustrated by the following example diff, extracted from drivers/usb/audio.c (later named drivers/usb/class/audio.c):\\n\\n--- a/original.c\\n+++ b/modified.c\\n@@ -2,7 +2,7 @@\\n if (!usbin_retire_desc(u, urb) &&\\n     u->flags & FLG_RUNNING &&\\n     !usbin_prepare_desc(u, urb) &&\\n-    (suret = usb_submit_urb(urb)) == 0) {\\n+    (suret = usb_submit_urb(urb,GFP_ATOMIC)) == 0) {\\n   u->flags |= mask;\\n } else {\\n   u->flags &= ~(mask | FLG_RUNNING);\\n\\n### Example 2: Changing the driver initialization protocol `check_region`\\nThe function check_region is used in the initialization of device drivers, in determining whether a given device is installed. In early versions of Linux, the kernel initializes device drivers sequentially. In this case, a driver determines whether its device is attached to a given port using the following protocol: (i) call check_region to find out whether the memory region associated with the port is already allocated to another driver, (ii) if not, then perform some driver-specific tests to identify the device attached to the port, and (iii) if the desired device is found, then call request_region to reserve the memory region for the current driver.\\n\\nIn more recent versions of Linux, the kernel initializes device drivers concurrently. In this case, between the call to check_region and the call to request_region some other driver may claim the same memory region and initialize the device. To solve this problem, starting with Linux 2.4.2, device-specific code was rewritten to replace the call to check_region in step (i) with a call to request_region, to reserve the memory region. Given this change, if in step (ii) the expected device is not found, then release_region must be used to release the memory region. The transformation is illustrated by the modifications to drivers/char/logibusmouse.c between Linux 2.4.18 and 2.4.19:\\n\\n--- a/original.c\\n+++ b/modified.c\\n@@ -1,13 +1,14 @@\\n static int __init logi_busmouse_init(void) {\\n-  if (check_region(LOGIBM_BASE, LOGIBM_EXTENT))\\n+  if (!request_region(LOGIBM_BASE, LOGIBM_EXTENT, \"busmouse\"))\\n     return -EIO;\\n   \\n   outb(MSE_CONFIG_BYTE, MSE_CONFIG_PORT);\\n   outb(MSE_SIGNATURE_BYTE, MSE_SIGNATURE_PORT);\\n   udelay(100L);   /* wait for reply from mouse */\\n-  if (inb(MSE_SIGNATURE_PORT) != MSE_SIGNATURE_BYTE)\\n+  if (inb(MSE_SIGNATURE_PORT) != MSE_SIGNATURE_BYTE) {\\n+    release_region(LOGIBM_BASE, LOGIBM_EXTENT);\\n     return -EIO;\\n-  ...\\n-  request_region(LOGIBM_BASE, LOGIBM_EXTENT, \"busmouse\");\\n+  }\\n+  ...\\n   msedev = register_busmouse(&busmouse);\\n   if (msedev < 0) { ... }\\n   else printk(KERN_INFO \"Logitech busmouse installed.\\\\n\");\\n\\n## Coccinelle\\nCoccinelle is a program transformation engine developed to address the problem of collateral evolution in drivers.

Let\\'s look at the diffs provided to understand the pattern.\\n\\nStarting with diff_0:\\nThe line changed here is the call to dasd_smalloc_request. The original code had four arguments after the magic number (1, 0, device), and it\\'s being changed to add a fifth argument, NULL. So the function call now has an extra NULL at the end.\\n\\nLooking at diff_1:\\nSimilarly, the dasd_smalloc_request call here is being modified. The original had four arguments (cplength, datasize, startdev), and now a fifth argument is added, which is blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req). \\n\\nSo the common pattern is that the function dasd_smalloc_request is being called with an additional fifth argument. In the first case, it\\'s NULL, and in the second case, it\\'s blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req). \\n\\nThe task is to write a semantic patch that adds this fifth argument wherever dasd_smalloc_request is called. The challenge is to match all existing calls and add the new argument. However, the two examples show different values for the new argument. But looking at the background knowledge, specifically the example where usb_submit_urb had an argument added, the semantic patch there added a specific value (GFP_ATOMIC) when under certain conditions. However, in this case, the fifth argument seems to vary. In the first diff, it\\'s NULL, and in the second, it\\'s blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req). \\n\\nWait, but maybe there\\'s a pattern here. Let me check the context. In diff_0, the fifth argument is NULL. The function call is in the context of allocating a request for RCD (Read Configuration Data). In diff_1, the fifth argument is blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req), which suggests it\\'s passing a pointer derived from the request structure, possibly related to block multi-queue (blk_mq) infrastructure.\\n\\nThis implies that the fifth argument might not be a fixed value but depends on the context. However, the input diffs are examples of the required changes, and the semantic patch needs to capture these instances. But perhaps there\\'s a common approach here. Wait, the problem statement says to write a semantic patch based on all the input diffs. So the semantic patch needs to cover both cases where the new argument is NULL and where it\\'s an expression like blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req). \\n\\nBut how can that be handled in a single semantic patch? Because Coccinelle\\'s semantic patches can use metavariables to match different expressions. Let\\'s see: In both cases, the function dasd_smalloc_request is being called with four arguments, and now a fifth is added. So perhaps the semantic patch should match any call to dasd_smalloc_request with four arguments and add a fifth, which could be either NULL or some expression.\\n\\nBut looking at the background examples, like the usb_submit_urb example, the semantic patch adds an argument based on context. But in the current problem, the added argument varies. How can this be handled?\\n\\nWait, maybe in the two diffs, the fifth argument is different, but perhaps there\\'s a rule in the kernel that when the fifth argument is not available (as in older code), it should be set to NULL or another specific value. But given that the two examples add different arguments, perhaps the correct approach is to capture the pattern where the fifth argument is added as either an existing expression or NULL.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the fifth argument is derived from a parameter of the function. For example, in diff_1, the new argument is blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req), where req is a parameter of the function. In diff_0, the function where the call is made (dasd_eckd_read_conf_lpm) does not have a req parameter, so perhaps the new argument is NULL in that case. \\n\\nSo maybe the semantic patch needs to add the fifth argument as blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req) if the function has a req parameter, otherwise add NULL. But Coccinelle\\'s SmPL can\\'t directly check the parameters of the enclosing function. Hmm. \\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the fifth argument is determined based on whether the function is in a context where a \\'req\\' variable exists. In diff_1, the call is within a function that has a \\'struct request *req\\' parameter. So in that case, the fifth argument is blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req), whereas in diff_0, there is no \\'req\\' variable, so it\\'s NULL.\\n\\nBut how can a semantic patch capture this? It would need to check if \\'req\\' is present in the current scope. Coccinelle allows using metavariables and context to check for variables. Let\\'s think.\\n\\nIn SmPL, we can write a rule that checks for the presence of \\'req\\' in the environment. For instance, if the call to dasd_smalloc_request is in a context where \\'req\\' is available, then add blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req) as the fifth argument. Otherwise, add NULL.\\n\\nBut how to structure this in a semantic patch? Let\\'s think about using two separate rules. One for the case where \\'req\\' is present, and another for when it\\'s not.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the fifth argument is a new parameter that is part of a macro or a new parameter added to the function. But according to the input diffs, the fifth argument is either NULL or blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req). \\n\\nWait, looking at the function dasd_smalloc_request. The original function probably had four parameters, and now it\\'s been updated to take a fifth. So all calls to this function must be updated to pass the fifth argument. The two examples show that in some cases the fifth argument is NULL and in others, it\\'s blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req). \\n\\nBut how do we determine which one to use in each case? Perhaps the fifth argument is a pointer to some data structure associated with the request. In the first diff (diff_0), the function call is not in the context of a block request (struct request *req is not present), so NULL is passed. In the second diff (diff_1), the function is called within a function that has a \\'struct request *req\\' parameter, so the fifth argument is derived from req.\\n\\nThis suggests that the semantic patch needs to add the fifth argument as blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req) when \\'req\\' is available in the current scope, and NULL otherwise.\\n\\nSo, in SmPL, we can use a disjunction (|) to handle both cases. For example:\\n\\nexpression E;\\nidentifier req;\\n@@\\n\\ndasd_smalloc_request(...,\\n- E\\n+ E, blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req)\\n) when req exists\\n\\nBut that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, we can capture the presence of \\'req\\' using a context.\\n\\nLooking at the example from the background knowledge, in the usb_submit_urb example, the semantic patch checks if the call is within a spin_lock_irqsave and spin_unlock_irqrestore block and adds GFP_ATOMIC. So the context is used to determine the correct argument.\\n\\nIn our case, perhaps the fifth argument is blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req) when the function call is in a context where \\'req\\' is available, otherwise NULL. To capture this, we can write two rules:\\n\\n1. When \\'req\\' is present in the environment, add blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req) as the fifth argument.\\n2. When \\'req\\' is not present, add NULL.\\n\\nBut how to express this in SmPL? Let\\'s try.\\n\\nFirst, we can write a rule that matches the call to dasd_smalloc_request with four arguments and adds the fifth as blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req) when there\\'s a \\'req\\' variable in the current scope.\\n\\nFor the first case (with req):\\n\\n@@\\nidentifier req;\\nexpression magic, num, size, dev;\\n@@\\n\\ndasd_smalloc_request(\\n  magic,\\n  num,\\n  size,\\n- dev\\n+ dev,\\n+ blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req)\\n  )\\n\\nBut this might not capture the exact pattern. Alternatively, using the full function call structure:\\n\\n@@\\nexpression E1, E2, E3, E4;\\nidentifier req;\\n@@\\n\\n- dasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4)\\n+ dasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4, blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req))\\n  when exists(req)\\n\\nBut the \\'when exists(req)\\' clause checks if \\'req\\' is declared in the current scope.\\n\\nFor the second case (without req), adding NULL:\\n\\n@@\\nexpression E1, E2, E3, E4;\\n@@\\n\\n- dasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4)\\n+ dasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4, NULL)\\n  when !exists(any req;)\\n\\nWait, but how to express \"when there\\'s no req variable in scope\"? The \\'exists\\' and \\'!\\' can be used for that.\\n\\nAlternatively, we can write two separate rules: one that adds blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req) when req exists, and another that adds NULL otherwise.\\n\\nBut in SmPL, the rules are applied in order. However, since the two rules are mutually exclusive (either req exists or not), we can write them as two separate rules.\\n\\nSo putting this together, the semantic patch would look like:\\n\\n@@\\nexpression E1, E2, E3, E4;\\nidentifier req;\\n@@\\n\\ndasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4\\n+ , blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req)\\n )\\n when exists(req);\\n\\n@@\\nexpression E1, E2, E3, E4;\\n@@\\n\\ndasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4\\n+ , NULL\\n )\\n when !exists(req);\\n\\nBut wait, in the second rule, how do we check that \\'req\\' does not exist? Because \\'req\\' is not declared in that context. So perhaps the when clause in the second rule is redundant if the first rule has already matched the cases where req exists. But Coccinelle applies the rules in the order they appear. So if the first rule matches cases where req exists, the second rule would handle the remaining cases, adding NULL.\\n\\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use a single rule with a disjunction. Alternatively, check if \\'req\\' is present and use the appropriate argument.\\n\\nAlternatively, the two examples in the input diffs have the fifth argument as either NULL or blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req). So perhaps the semantic patch can capture both possibilities by allowing the fifth argument to be either of those expressions, depending on the presence of \\'req\\'.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the fifth argument is determined by the presence of a \\'req\\' parameter in the surrounding function. For example, in the second diff, the function has a \\'struct request *req\\' parameter, so the fifth argument is blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req). In the first diff, the function does not have a \\'req\\' parameter, so it\\'s NULL.\\n\\nBut how to check if the function has a parameter named \\'req\\'?\\n\\nIn SmPL, we can use context around the function call. For example, if the function in which the call occurs has a parameter named \\'req\\', then we can add the blk_mq... argument. Otherwise, add NULL.\\n\\nBut how to express that in SmPL?\\n\\nLet\\'s look at the example of the usb_submit_urb semantic patch. They used the context of being between spin_lock_irqsave and spin_unlock_irqrestore to decide to add GFP_ATOMIC.\\n\\nSo in our case, perhaps we can check if the function where the call is made has a \\'struct request *req\\' parameter, and if so, add blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req), else add NULL.\\n\\nBut how to capture that in SmPL?\\n\\nThe semantic patch would need to match the function definition parameters and then the calls within that function. For example:\\n\\n@@\\nidentifier fn;\\nparameter struct request *req;\\n@@\\n\\nfn(...) {\\n  ... \\n  dasd_smalloc_request(...);\\n  ...\\n}\\n\\nBut I\\'m not sure. Alternatively, using context in the rule.\\n\\nAnother approach: Use a metavariable to capture the fifth argument. For example, in the two diffs, the fifth argument is either NULL or blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req). So perhaps the fifth argument is an expression that can be either of these. But how to represent this in a semantic patch.\\n\\nWait, but the task is to write a semantic patch based on the input diffs. The two input diffs show two different ways of adding the fifth argument. So the semantic patch must cover both cases.\\n\\nBut in Coccinelle, a semantic patch can use a disjunction (|) to match different possibilities. However, since the fifth argument is dependent on the presence of \\'req\\', perhaps we need to capture that.\\n\\nSo the approach could be:\\n\\nFor all calls to dasd_smalloc_request with four arguments, add a fifth argument which is either blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req) if \\'req\\' is present, or NULL otherwise.\\n\\nIn SmPL:\\n\\n@@\\nexpression E1, E2, E3, E4;\\nidentifier req;\\n@@\\n\\ndasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4\\n+,\\n+  if (exists(req)) { blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req) } else { NULL }\\n)\\n\\nBut SmPL doesn\\'t support conditionals in the replacement like that. So we need to write two separate rules.\\n\\nFirst rule: when \\'req\\' exists in the current context, add blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req).\\n\\nSecond rule: otherwise, add NULL.\\n\\nBut how to express the existence of \\'req\\' in the current context. Coccinelle\\'s \\'exists\\' function can check if a variable is declared in the current scope.\\n\\nSo for the first rule:\\n\\n@@\\nexpression E1, E2, E3, E4;\\nidentifier req;\\nposition p;\\n@@\\n\\ndasd_smalloc_request@p(E1, E2, E3, E4)\\n+ dasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4, blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req))\\nwhen exists(req);\\n\\nWait, but that would require the entire function call to be replaced. Alternatively, using the syntax where we add the fifth argument. But the original line has four arguments, and we need to add the fifth.\\n\\nSo the correct approach is to match the original call with four arguments and add the fifth.\\n\\nThe SmPL syntax for adding an argument would involve modifying the function call\\'s argument list.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nOriginal code: dasd_smalloc_request(a, b, c, d)\\n\\nModified code: dasd_smalloc_request(a, b, c, d, e)\\n\\nSo in the semantic patch, we can write:\\n\\n@@\\nexpression E1, E2, E3, E4, E5;\\nidentifier req;\\n@@\\n\\n- dasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4)\\n+ dasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4, E5)\\n\\nBut how to set E5 based on the presence of \\'req\\'?\\n\\nAlternatively, use two separate rules:\\n\\n1. When \\'req\\' is present:\\n\\n@@\\nexpression E1, E2, E3, E4;\\nidentifier req;\\n@@\\n\\ndasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4\\n+ , blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req)\\n)\\n// when exists(req)\\n\\nBut the \\'when\\' clause is optional. However, the rule would only match if \\'req\\' is in scope.\\n\\nBut how to ensure that \\'req\\' is indeed available. The \\'identifier req;\\' metavariable declaration will match any identifier named \\'req\\' in the current context, but we need to check that it\\'s declared.\\n\\nAlternatively, the rule would be:\\n\\n@@\\nexpression E1, E2, E3, E4;\\nidentifier req;\\n@@\\n\\ndasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4)\\n... when exists(req\\n   )\\n\\nBut I\\'m not sure. Let me look up Coccinelle\\'s documentation.\\n\\nThe \\'exists\\' operator in Coccinelle can check if a variable is in scope. For example, exists(struct request *req) would check if there\\'s a declaration of \\'req\\' as a struct request pointer in the current scope.\\n\\nBut in the second diff, \\'req\\' is a parameter of the enclosing function. So in that context, exists(req) would be true. In the first diff, there\\'s no \\'req\\' parameter, so exists(req) is false.\\n\\nSo the first rule would add blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req) when req exists, and the second rule would add NULL otherwise.\\n\\nSo the semantic patch would have two rules:\\n\\nFirst rule:\\n\\n@@\\nexpression E1, E2, E3, E4;\\nidentifier req;\\n@@\\n\\ndasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4\\n+ , blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req)\\n)\\n// Add when req exists\\nwhen exists(req);\\n\\nSecond rule:\\n\\n@@\\nexpression E1, E2, E3, E4;\\n@@\\n\\ndasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4\\n+ , NULL\\n)\\n// When req does not exist\\nwhen !exists(req);\\n\\nBut how to express the \\'when\\' clauses correctly. The \\'exists\\' function can check for a variable in the current scope.\\n\\nIn the first rule, we check if there\\'s a variable named \\'req\\' in the current scope. If so, add blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req) as the fifth argument.\\n\\nIn the second rule, we add NULL when \\'req\\' is not present.\\n\\nBut perhaps the second rule can omit the \\'when\\' clause, as Coccinelle would apply it to any dasd_smalloc_request call with four arguments that wasn\\'t already matched by the first rule.\\n\\nSo putting it all together, the semantic patch would look like:\\n\\n@@\\nexpression E1, E2, E3, E4;\\nidentifier req;\\n@@\\n\\ndasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4\\n+ , blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req)\\n)\\nwhen exists(req);\\n\\n@@\\nexpression E1, E2, E3, E4;\\n@@\\n\\ndasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4\\n+ , NULL\\n);\\n\\nThis way, the first rule matches calls where \\'req\\' is in scope and adds blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req), and the second rule adds NULL to the remaining calls.\\n\\nBut wait, in the first diff (diff_0), the fifth argument is added as NULL. The function dasd_eckd_read_conf_lpm does not have a \\'req\\' parameter, so the second rule would apply. In the second diff (diff_1), the function dasd_eckd_build_cp_cmd_track has a \\'struct request *req\\' parameter, so the first rule would apply.\\n\\nThus, this semantic patch would handle both cases.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s verify the syntax. In SmPL, the rules are written with the metavariables declared first. Each rule starts with @@ and then the metavariable declarations, followed by the code pattern.\\n\\nSo the first rule would be:\\n\\n@@\\nexpression E1, E2, E3, E4;\\nidentifier req;\\n@@\\n\\ndasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4)\\n+ dasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4, blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req))\\nwhen exists(req);\\n\\nWait, but the original function call has four arguments. The way to represent adding a fifth argument would be to use a line split. For example:\\n\\n- dasd_smalloc_request(DASD_ECKD_MAGIC, 1 , 0, device);\\n+ dasd_smalloc_request(DASD_ECKD_MAGIC, 1, 0, device, NULL);\\n\\nSo in SmPL, the code would need to match the original line and then add the fifth argument. The correct way to write the rule is:\\n\\n@@\\nexpression E1, E2, E3, E4;\\nidentifier req;\\nposition p;\\n@@\\n\\ndasd_smalloc_request@p(E1, E2, E3, E4)\\n+ dasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4, blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req))\\nwhen exists(req);\\n\\nBut the function call might be split across lines, so using the position variable p to capture the original position.\\n\\nAlternatively, using the syntax where the arguments are matched and the fifth is added:\\n\\n@@\\nexpression E1, E2, E3, E4;\\nidentifier req;\\n@@\\n\\ndasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4\\n+ , blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req)\\n)\\nwhen exists(req);\\n\\nSimilarly for the second rule:\\n\\n@@\\nexpression E1, E2, E3, E4;\\n@@\\n\\ndasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4\\n+ , NULL\\n);\\n\\nThis should cover both cases. The first rule adds the fifth argument as blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req) when \\'req\\' is present, and the second rule adds NULL otherwise.\\n\\nTherefore, the final semantic patch would consist of these two rules. The metavariables are declared as expressions for the first four arguments and identifier \\'req\\' for the first rule. The second rule uses expressions for the first four arguments and adds NULL.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s assemble the semantic patch.\\n\\nFirst rule:\\n\\n@@\\nexpression E1, E2, E3, E4;\\nidentifier req;\\n@@\\n\\ndasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4\\n+ , blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req)\\n)\\nwhen exists(req);\\n\\nSecond rule:\\n\\n@@\\nexpression E1, E2, E3, E4;\\n@@\\n\\ndasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4\\n+ , NULL\\n);\\n\\nBut Coccinelle\\'s SmPL uses @@ to separate the metavariables and the code. Each rule is enclosed in @@ ... @@.\\n\\nWait, the structure should be:\\n\\nFor each rule, the format is:\\n\\n@@\\nmetavariables...\\n@@\\n\\ncode pattern...\\n\\nSo each rule starts with @@, then the metavariable declarations, then another @@, then the code pattern.\\n\\nSo the first rule would look like:\\n\\n@@\\nexpression E1, E2, E3, E4;\\nidentifier req;\\n@@\\n\\ndasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4)\\n+ dasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4, blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req))\\nwhen exists(req);\\n\\nBut the original code has four arguments, and the modified code has five. To represent this in SmPL, the correct way is to show the original line and then the modified line. However, since the function call may span multiple lines (as in the input diffs), the semantic patch should match the original structure.\\n\\nAlternatively, using the syntax that allows for inserting the fifth argument. In SmPL, the patch would look like:\\n\\n@@\\nexpression E1, E2, E3, E4;\\nidentifier req;\\n@@\\n\\n- dasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4)\\n+ dasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4, blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req))\\nwhen exists(req);\\n\\nBut this would replace the original four-argument call with a five-argument call adding blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req). Similarly for the second rule:\\n\\n@@\\nexpression E1, E2, E3, E4;\\n@@\\n\\n- dasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4)\\n+ dasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4, NULL)\\n\\nBut in the input diffs, the line was split into multiple lines. For example, in diff_0, the line was:\\n\\n-  cqr = dasd_smalloc_request(DASD_ECKD_MAGIC, 1 , 0, \\n-                             device);\\n+  cqr = dasd_smalloc_request(DASD_ECKD_MAGIC, 1, 0, device, NULL);\\n\\nBut the semantic patch as written would handle this because the expressions E1, E2, E3, E4 would capture all four arguments, regardless of line breaks.\\n\\nThus, the final semantic patch would be:\\n\\n@@\\nexpression E1, E2, E3, E4;\\nidentifier req;\\n@@\\n\\ndasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4\\n+ , blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req)\\n)\\nwhen exists(req);\\n\\n@@\\nexpression E1, E2, E3, E4;\\n@@\\n\\ndasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4\\n+ , NULL\\n);\\n\\nBut in SmPL, the code changes are represented with \\'-\\' and \\'+\\' lines. So for a function call that is being modified, the original line (with four args) is preceded by \\'-\\', and the new line (with five args) is preceded by \\'+\\'.\\n\\nAlternatively, the correct SmPL syntax would be:\\n\\n@@\\nexpression E1, E2, E3, E4;\\nidentifier req;\\n@@\\n\\n- dasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4)\\n+ dasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4, blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req))\\n  when exists(req);\\n\\n@@\\nexpression E1, E2, E3, E4;\\n@@\\n\\n- dasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4)\\n+ dasd_smalloc_request(E1, E2, E3, E4, NULL);\\n\\nBut the line continuation in the original code (like in diff_0) may need to be accounted for, but Coccinelle\\'s SmPL handles line breaks with the \\'...\\' operator. However, in this case, the function call is a single expression, and the line breaks are handled by the metavariables.\\n\\nThus, the final answer should be the two rules as above.'}}],\n",
